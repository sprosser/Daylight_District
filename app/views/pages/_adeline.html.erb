Adeline

We see the storm that’s coming on
Can’t retreat intent and weather on
We see the storm that’s brought the dawn
Won’t repeat the past before we’re gone

Release my doubt
An empty bottle or promise for the night

Adeline a vision to get lost inside
Adeline secret look of auburn pride
Adeline a vision to get lost inside
A vision to get lost inside

Our souls are slowly dragging on
Can’t blame our debts before we’re gone
Our souls embrace the sea of calm
Won’t repeat the path we’ve been walking on

Release my doubt
An empty bottle or promise for the night

Adeline a vision to get lost inside
Adeline secret look of auburn pride
Adeline a vision to get lost inside
A vision to get lost inside

Instrumental solo

Adeline a vision to get lost inside
Adeline secret look of auburn skies
Adeline a vision to get lost inside
A vision to get lost inside

We see the storm that’s coming on
Won’t repeat the past before we’re gone
