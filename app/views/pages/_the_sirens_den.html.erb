The Siren’s Den

Take this bottle, Take these pills
Take myself from myself and I’m still
Still trapped in this prison
What’s left of my reason
Can you hear me?

Not all dreams spirit our souls away
Not all derelicts destined to stay
Stay trapped in this prison
Holes left in my reason

Secrets in my cell of scandals under lock and key
All alone confined within these walls of silence
Broken only from their righteous preaching choirs
Am I a saint of circumstance or lost in
The siren’s den

Take my body, Take my friends
Take myself from myself in the end
Still trapped in this prison
Whats left of my reason
Someone save me

Where’s the angel I thought I would find
My theories have run out of time
Time stops in this prison
This life's out of season

Secrets in my cell, Of scandals under lock and key
All alone confined within the walls of silence
Broken only from their righteous preaching choirs
Am I a saint of circumstance or lost in

The siren’s den, the siren’s den

Will I survive the dark tides of my soul
Can I find my self control
Will I withstand the fall from these heights
Can I radiate through the night

Take this bottle, Take these pills
Take myself from myself and I’m still
Still trapped in this prison
What’s left of my reason

Secrets in my cell, Of scandals under lock and key
All alone confined within the walls of silence
Broken only from their righteous preaching choirs
Am I a saint of circumstance or lost in

The siren’s den, the siren’s den, the siren’s den
