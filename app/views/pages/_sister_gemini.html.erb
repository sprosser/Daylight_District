Sister Gemini

Has Zion fought the line
or betrayed the rules of mankind
Lacuna’s absent weep
When her hand abandoned reach

All the seraph angels sing for her
Hallelujah 
All the precious children cry for her
Hallelujah

Sister Gemini 

Oh god, the countless lives we’ve lived
to return as kings and queens discord
Oh god, the years of tears we’re looking for
the legions wait desiring one 

All the cherub angels sing for her
Hallelujah 
All the loving children cry for her
Hallelujah
